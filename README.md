This is a simple currency converter made in a couple hours for exercising third parties API calls 
I am using:
  freecurrencyapi.com API for fetching the exchange rate between the different currencies
  RestTemplate from Spring Webflux to make the API Calls and JsonNode to extract the effective response
  Thymeleaf for server side rendering of the html page
